**INTRODUCTION**

In today's health-conscious world, tracking calorie intake is crucial for maintaining a balanced diet and achieving fitness goals. However, manually logging the calorie content of each meal can be tedious and error-prone. This project aims to simplify the process by leveraging machine learning techniques to automatically estimate the calories in food items based on their images and nutritional data.

**OBJECTIVES**

- To develop a user-friendly web interface for uploading food images and estimating the calories.
- To implement machine learning models using TenserFlow for the estimation of calorie based on food images.
-  Develop a model that accurately estimates the calorie content of various food. 
â€ƒ

**KEY FEATURES**

- **Image Recognition**: Use Machine learning learning models to identify food items from images.
- **Calorie Estimation**: Estimate the calorie content based on recognized food items and portion sizes.
- **Nutritional Database**: Integrate with a comprehensive database to fetch nutritional information for various foods.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provide an easy-to-use interface for users to upload images and receive calorie estimates.

**TECHNOLOGIES USED**

- **Machine Learning**: Implemented using TensorFlow and Keras for building and training neural networks.
- **Frontend Tools**: HTML for structure, CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity.
- **Backend Tools**: Python for server-side logic, SQLite for database management.
